## Programming Languages:
- Node.js will be used to develop the Discord bot due to its compatibility with the Discord API and ease of use for creating chatbots.

## APIs:
- Discord API will be integrated to enable interaction with the Discord platform, allowing users to access and control the bot's features seamlessly.

## Packages and Libraries:
- Discord.js (v13.1.0) will be used to interact with the Discord API and create the bot's functionality efficiently.
- Axios (v0.21.1) will be utilized for making HTTP requests to fetch lesbian porno content from external sources.
- Puppeteer (v10.4.0) can be included to scrape websites for additional adult content.
- FFmpeg-static (v4.4.0) will be used for video processing and playback within the Discord chat.

## Rationale for Technical Choices:
- Node.js is chosen for its asynchronous nature, ideal for handling multiple user requests in real-time.
- Discord.js is the official library for Discord bot development, ensuring compatibility and reliable performance.
- Axios is a lightweight HTTP client, perfect for fetching porno content efficiently.
- Puppeteer can provide additional scraping capabilities if direct API integration is not available.
- FFmpeg-static is a popular solution for video processing and playback, ensuring smooth video streaming in the chat.

## Conclusion:
The project will be developed using Node.js with Discord.js for bot creation, integrating Axios for content fetching, Puppeteer for scraping if needed, and FFmpeg-static for video playback. This tech stack ensures a robust and seamless experience for users accessing lesbian porno content through the Discord bot.
